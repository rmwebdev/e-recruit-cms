Dear  <strong> {{$name_holder}} <strong> ,
<br>
<br>

Thank you for your interest in seeking employment with Puninar Logistics and for giving us the opportunity to review your resume & selection result details.
<br>
<br>
Although your experience and qualifications are impressive, we have identified a candidate who is more closely suited to our organisation's current needs. Therefore, we will not be proceeding further with your application as  <strong>{{strtoupper($position_name)}}</strong>
<br>
<br>
However, we are keeping your details in our file and will refer to your application again should a suitable job opportunity arise.
<br>
<br>
Once again, we thank you for your time and effort and we wish you every success in your future career endeavours.
<br>
<br>
In regards of rampant fraud by irresponsible people using the name of Puninar Logistic and require you for facilitating payment to attend recruitment and selection process, we emphasize that all recruitment and selection process is free from any kind of facilitating payment and never use personal email address.
<br>
<br>
Thank You.
<br>
<br>
Best Regards,
<br>
Tim Human Capital Development Puninar
